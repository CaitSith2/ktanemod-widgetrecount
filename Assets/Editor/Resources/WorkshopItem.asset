  Title: Widget Expand
  Description: "This mod increases the number of widget slots that will be taken up
    on a bomb. Normally, a bomb will consist of 1 serial number and 5 other widgets.
    Although the number of serial number widgets is not configurable, you can configure
    the number of other widget slots to include. It currently does not allow configuration
    of what widgets to pick from though.\r\n\nNew mod settings will have a field called
    \"fileVersion\", which should have the value of 2. If you have an old mod settings
    file, it will get updated upon running the game after updating.\n\r\n[h1]Configuration[/h1]\nTo
    change the number of widget slots taken up on a bomb, you can edit the mod settings
    for the widget expander service. The configuration now consists of the possible
    options:\n- [b][i]\"allowWidgetCountChange\"[/i][/b] - When true, this will allow
    the widget expander to change the allowable number of widgets on a bomb; when
    false, bombs will revert to generating with 5 widgets (and 1 serial number).\n-
    [b][i]\"minimumWidgetCount\"[/i][/b] and [b][i]\"maximumWidgetCount\"[/i][/b]
    - Controls the range of possible numbers of widgets that can appear on any given
    bomb; upon bomb generation it will pick a random number of widgets in the inclusive
    range between [b][i]\"minimumWidgetCount\"[/i][/b] and [b][i]\"maximumWidgetCount\"[/i][/b].
    To force a bomb to always have the same number of widgets, just set both properties
    to the same numeric value. By default from download, the configuration will be
    a selection of 7 widgets (min & max).\r\n- [b][i]\"allowSerialNumberChange\"[/i][/b]
    - When true, this will allow all basic alphanumeric characters (A-Z, 0-9) to appear
    on the serial number, including 'O' and '0'; when false, the serial number will
    revert to regenerating with vanilla behaviour.\n- [b][i]\"minimumCustomIndicators\"[/i][/b]
    - Controls the number of allowable custom indicator labels that can be selected
    from. By default in the game there are only 11 indicator labels, and after that,
    indicators would generate with \"NLL\" as its label. Adding more custom indicators
    widens the pool of possible indicator labels that can be selected from, before
    reaching \"NLL\".\n- [b][i]\"allowCustomIndicators\"[/i][/b] - When true, this
    will allow custom indicator labels to be selected from; when false, indicator
    labels will only pick from the 11 indicator labels that normally appear in the
    vanilla game.\n\nThanks to CaitSith and samfun123 for implementing the recent
    extra functionality.\n\r\nIn the future, I'd like to have it feature in the freeplay
    case as a custom setting (where it'll fit though, I don't know!), and also have
    it be configurable in some way for custom missions. That way the vanilla game
    wouldn't necessarily get affected by this mod."
