  Title: Widget Expand
  Description: "This mod increases the number of widget slots that will be taken up
    on a bomb. Normally, a bomb will consist of 1 serial number and 5 other widgets.
    Although the number of serial number widgets is not configurable, you can configure
    the number of other widget slots to include. It currently does not allow configuration
    of what widgets to pick from though.\r\n\r\nTo change the number of widget slots
    taken up on a bomb, you can edit the mod settings for the module. There will be
    two values to tweak: [b][i]\"minimumWidgetCount\"[/i][/b] and [b][i]\"maximumWidgetCount\"[/i][/b].
    Each time a bomb is generated, it will pick a random number of widgets in the
    inclusive range between [b][i]\"minimumWidgetCount\"[/i][/b] and [b][i]\"maximumWidgetCount\"[/i][/b].
    To force a bomb to always have the same number of widgets, just set both properties
    to the same numeric value.\r\n\r\nThis was an experimental mod that I messed around
    with over Christmas, and I've just decided to upload it as it currently stands.
    It's not perfect, and there are likely bugs with it, so subscribers beware!\r\n\r\nIn
    the future, I'd like to have it feature in the freeplay case as a custom setting
    (where it'll fit though, I don't know!), and also have it be configurable in some
    way for custom missions. That way the vanilla game wouldn't necessarily get affected
    by this mod."
